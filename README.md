# Journey Log

### App Platform

This app is a web app deployed at [Jouneylog](https://journeylog.netlify.app)

### Tech Stack

This app is a Next.js web app built using React written in TypeScript, TailwindCSS and it leverages the MUI datepicker and chart libaries.

### App Intro

This app is Called Journey Log and is an app which allows users to track time spent on activities.

#### Functionality

The app allows users to create activities and for each activity, add or import entries to their log as well as set daily goals to reach. Their stats for the activity are displayed in three ways: numbers, a graph, and a heatmap. The target audience is anyone that wants to start a long term comitment and solves the problem of not having an easy way to see progress long term.

#### Development Process

I used AI primarily for writting bulky bits of code or getting a template setup for myself to tweak. For example, I used Copilot to generate most of the data access functions and used ChatGPT to generate the ThemeProvider including all the themes (colors and theme objects). This greatly sped up the development process. I used Copilot's inline editor on VScode for debuging and making simple changes to large chunks of code.

#### Usefulness

The app is useful as it solves a very prominent problem we may not be directly aware of, that of not keeping up commitments we set for ourselves. If someone wants to commit to doing something everyday and they miss a day, this will eventually be forgotten. However, if you track using Journey Log, you will be visually reminded by seeing a gap in the heatmap. It will keep people more accountable and help them reach their goals.
